# Efficient-Data-Stream-Anomaly-Detection

The data stream simulation in this project generates a sequence of data points that mimic a real-time stream. It uses a sine wave pattern with added random noise to simulate normal data. Occasionally, anomalies are introduced by adding a large, random value to simulate abnormal behavior. The simulation runs for a specified number of iterations (`n=1000` by default) and yields one data point at a time, making it ideal for testing anomaly detection in a streaming context.
